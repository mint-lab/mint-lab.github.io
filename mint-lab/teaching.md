## Undergraduate Courses
### Digital Logic (also known as Digital System)
> Making Digital Computers from Scratch!

* This course provides an introduction to **elements and theories of modern digital systems** such as computers, smartphones, and more. The course includes number systems, logic gates, and their applications to my own digital circuits. As the subtitle, _Making Digital Computers from Scratch_, said, this course help students understand basic elements and operations of modern digital computers. Finally **students will implement a simple CPU by their hands** with [Logisim-evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution).
* Course code: 109256 (for 2nd-year CSE students)
* History: 2021-Spring, 2022-Spring

### Open Source Software (shortly OSS)
> Starting My Open-source Project!

* This course provides an introduction to open-source software (shortly OSS) which has been significantly utilized in recent IT industries. This course investigates on representative OSS examples and stimulates students to start their own OSS project. At first, this course starts with **learning [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/)** and tries to build experiences of Python-based OSS such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)/[SciPy](https://scipy.org/) (for scientific computing), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) (for machine learning), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (for deep learning). Beyond usage of those OSS tools, this course aims students to **understand important mathematical concepts intuitively** and **build basic background of machine learning and deep learning**.
* Course code: 109075 (for 2nd- and 3rd-year CSE students)
* History: 2021-Fall, 2022-Fall

### Computer Vision (shortly CV)
> Understanding CV and Making My CV Project!

* This course provides **theories and applications of computer vision such as image processing, distortion**. This course help students to understand camera projection, ..., and their applications to computer vision. This course will also motivate students to start their project using computer vision.
* Prerequisite: Open Source Software (109075)
* Course code: 109079 (for 4th-year CSE students)
* History: 2023-Spring



## Graduate Courses
### 3D Computer Vision (shortly 3DV)
> 3D Computer Vision from Fundamental to Applications

* This course covers
* Course code: 9441076 (for graduate students)
