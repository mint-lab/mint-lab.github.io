## Undergraduate Courses
### Digital Logic
> _Digital Computers from Scratch!_

* Introduction: This course provides an introduction to **elements and theories of modern digital systems** such as computers, smartphones, and more. The course includes number systems, logic gates, and their applications to my own digital circuits. As the subtitle, _Digital Computers from Scratch_, said, this course help students understand the basic elements and operations of modern digital computers. Finally **students will implement their simple digital computer by their hands** with [Logisim-evolution](https://github.com/logisim-evolution/logisim-evolution).
* Course code: 109256 (for 2nd-year CSE students)
* History: 2021-Spring, 2022-Spring

### Open Source Software (shortly OSS)
> Starting My Open-source Project!

* Introduction: This course provides an introduction to open-source software (shortly OSS) which has been significantly utilized in recent IT industries. This course investigates on representative OSS examples and stimulates students to start their own OSS project. At first, this course starts with **learning [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/)** and tries to build experiences of Python-based OSS such as [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)/[SciPy](https://scipy.org/) (for scientific computing), [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) (for machine learning), and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) (for deep learning). Beyond usage of those OSS tools, this course aims students to **understand important mathematical concepts intuitively** and **build basic background of machine learning and deep learning**.
* Course code: 109075 (for 2nd- and 3rd-year CSE students)
* History: 2021-Fall

### Natual Language Processing (shortly NLP)
> Understanding NLP and Making My NLP Project!

* Introduction: This course provides **theories and methods for natural language processing such as text modeling, keyword extraction, text classification, and text generation**. This course help students to understand machine learning, deep learning, and their applications to natural language processing. This course will also motivate students to start their project using natural language processing.
* Prerequisite: Open Source Software (109075)
* Course code: 109083 (for 4th-year CSE students)
